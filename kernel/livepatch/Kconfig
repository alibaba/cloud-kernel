	  Say Y here if you want to support kernel live patching.

	  module uses the interface provided by this option to register
	  a patch, causing calls to patched functions to be redirected
	  to new function code contained in the patch module.

	  Livepatch consistency model configuration.
	  There are two kinds of consistency model for kernel hotfix:
	  1. stop machine model for Kpatch (Red Hat)
		2. per-task model for kGraft (SUSE)

	  stop machine model is simple, less chances to make mistakes
	  stop machine model is widely used by Kpatch, which is proved to be
	  safe and robust enough.
